//typeof is keyword to find what the type is..

const a = 3;
const s = 'hi';
const b = true;
const d = 4.5;


console.log(typeof a);
console.log(typeof d);
console.log(typeof s);
console.log(typeof b);
// The typeof keyword understoods differents between of string,boolean and number but doesnt understood differents between of number and double.. it agrees both of them are same and number..  
console.log(typeof 2);
console.log(typeof '2');
//the different between both of them are -''- but we change to write string to number with other transactions
